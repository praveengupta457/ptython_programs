# 1.>>class... 2.>>object 3.>>refrence variable
# 1. class== a blueprint of templete,model,design... and class is a specification and design to create multiple object
#    class repersent the data members , proprty and behaviour of object.

# 2. object==a physical existenece of a class..or an instance of class is called object
# one to many (from one class we can create many objects)

# 3.refrÄ“nce variable> used to refer object we can perform operation on the objecets and (object can have n number of ref. var)
#  using reference variable we can access the property and method of an object 
# e.g...a model of tv say sony 12 model >> has n number of copies and are some action can be performed on it using remote 
# (where tv model is [class] , n number copies is[object] and [remote] is reference variable) 

# static variable .. variable that not varries from object to object called static variable
# instance variable .. variable that varries from object to object called instance variable

#  class studdent...
#  every student has diffrence name ,roll, age etc etc but the school name is static so student data are instance variable and school is static variable 
# various places to declare static variable 1> within the class directly and outside of any method and constructor
